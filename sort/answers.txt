sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I know it is Bubble Sort because the already sorted data run much faster than the selection sort

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Because the values are reversed and it still the fastest algorithm.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Because the sorted data have about the same real sorting time as the unsorted data.
